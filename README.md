Sample

* Gender: F

* Checking In: 11/7
* Checking Out: 11/10
* Notes: We'll go jetskiing together!


The List
========


* Name: Jean-Philippe Boily
* Gender: M
* Github Nick: @jipiboily
* Checking In: 11/6
* Checking Out: 11/11
* Notes: I'll be at Ruby On Sails too. So ideally, I would checkin the day before Ruby on Sails and leave the day after Rubyconf. That said, I might also get a cheaper room elsewhere (alone) for those nights.
